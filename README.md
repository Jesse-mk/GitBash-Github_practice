# github_practice
learning how to use Git/GitHub through Git Bash rather than just using the user interface.

Steps:
1.	Git init (initialize the empty git repository)
2.	Git remote set-url [insert url here]
3.	Git add ‘practice github.ipnb’ (add the files you want to commit)
4.	Git commit [file name] (type at the VERY TOP IN YELLOW the comments you want to add 
(change nothing else, will list the files changing as trackable and the others are untrackable) use command i to insert and :wq to exit.
5.	Git remote add origin [insert github repository url on github]
6.	Git push origin master (will count objects, not necessarily 1:1) and now on github!
